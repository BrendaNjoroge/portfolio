        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Job Experience</h3>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Brenda, an entrepreneur, ballet instructor and aspiring web developer. I have previous experience in the real estate sector as a property manager.</p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I pursued my O-levels in Uganda where I attained the UCE certificate at St.Lawrence College Paris-Palais, and later joined St.Lawrence Horizon campus for my A-levels where I attained the UACE certificate. I am currently a student at Moringa School pursuing Web Development.</p>

        <p>Why coding? I love to create. I have a passion for making things from scratch, from baking, to making DIY projects, to drawing, I really love seeing things come together from nothing. Coding is one of those things I have had on my to-do list for years, and I have decided to finally give it a go!</p>
