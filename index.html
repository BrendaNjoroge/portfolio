        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <h3>Job Experience</h3>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Brenda, an entrepreneur, ballet instructor and aspiring web developer. I have previous experience in the real estate sector as a property manager.</p>
    
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I pursued my O-levels in Uganda where I attained the UCE certificate at St.Lawrence College Paris-Palais, and later joined St.Lawrence Horizon campus for my A-levels where I attained the UACE certificate. I am currently a student at Moringa School pursuing Web Development.</p>

        <p>Why coding? I love to create. I have a passion for making things from scratch, from baking, to making DIY projects, to drawing, I really love seeing things come together from nothing. Coding is one of those things I have had on my to-do list for years, and I have decided to finally give it a go!</p>
    
        <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        <p>Here are a list of my hobbies and interests in no particular order of preference:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Baking:</strong>What is it about baking that makes it so satisfying? The slow process of measuring, sifting, stirring and waiting for the dough to rise in the oven as the house fills up with the scent of vanilla or chocolate. In short, I love baking for the baking part of it, and most definitely the sweet treats right after. </li>
            <li><strong>Camping:</strong>I love engaging with nature and wildlife, leaving behind the hustle of city life. Setting up the tent, sitting by the campfire and staring at the stars is always so therapeutic.</li>
            <li><strong>Listening to music:</strong>I find listening to music very relaxing and enjoyable. It helps me ease stress and anxiety, as well as practice my dancing skills. </li>
            <li><strong>Cats:</strong>I am obsessed with cats. What's not to love about them? Their cute paws, button nose, purring, I can go on and on, but let me stop myself. I often volunteer at KSPCA from time to time, to help out with cats that have been rescued.</li>
        </ol>
